For this lab, you will create a website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to previous labs. You must create your own original work.

Your main goal with this project is to connect to an API using JavaScript, like what we did with Lab 2. You should find an open API (e.g. free, but perhaps requires registration), and write a site that uses this API to present the data. Choose an API that has multiple calls and returns complex data, e.g. similar to the weather API we have used.

You should look at this list of open APIs (Links to an external site.). Avoid APIs that use OAuth for authentication, unless you are already familiar with how to implement this or are an experienced JavaScript programmer. Be careful to choose one that has YES listed for CORS. This means you can use purely client-side code to fetch data from the API.

Pair Programming
You are welcome to work alone or in a group of two on this project.  if you work as a pair, you need to follow the pair programming guidelines in the syllabus, contribute equally, and turn in the same URL.  

Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

The site uses JavaScript and fetch to get data from an external API
The site has sufficient complexity -- you need to fetch and display data from at least three different REST endpoints. For example, fetching and displaying a list of Pokemon characters is not enough. You need to demonstrate that you can build a robust app using a complex API. A good comparison would be the weather API we used where it has endpoints for the current weather, the forecast, and lots of data it returns.
The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account.

Submission
Please submit to Canvas the URL for your web server, where your code is running (e.g. on your DigitalOcean server). On this website, in a footer, you must include a link to your GitHub repository. Use a unique URL for the project, e.g. cp2.emmasmith.org.

If you worked with a pair programming partner, both of you should submit the assignment and both of you should list the other person's name in the website footer and in the assignment submission.

Rubric for Grading
We will grade your projects based on:

how clearly you present the data from the API
the complexity of the app you build
how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.
TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

50 points: Meets the basic requirements of using JavaScript to fetch data from an external API and has a footer
20 points: Calls three different API endpoints
20 points: Data that is presented has many attributes that are returned from the API endpoints
10 points: Excellent use of web design principles, 2 points each for the following:
responsive design -- the site should work as well on mobile as on desktops; mobile-first designs for mobile, then expands to desktop
white space -- use white space effectively to highlight different areas of the page and to make the site easy to understand
typography -- use appropriate font sizes and paragraph widths to distinguish the importance of different sections and to make the site easy to read

consistency -- everything should match

color -- use color effectively to make the site appealing -- start with a black and white design and add color last, use colors that are complementary
